They told me the federal bankruptcy law doesn't allow my case to proceed in court at this time, and all claims against the defendant must be made as part of the bankruptcy proceeding. But the funny thing is the company is still operating exactly as they were before the bankruptcy. They filed bankruptcy just to get out of a big debt. Now my question is, do I have the right to refile another claim for the same case over again? (not appeal, its just total new claim but for the same problem that happened)?
